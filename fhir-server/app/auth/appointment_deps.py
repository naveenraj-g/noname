Appointment ownership dependency.

get_authorized_appointment — reusable FastAPI dependency that:
  1. Resolves the public appointment_id from the URL path.
  2. Fetches the AppointmentModel from the database.
  3. Verifies that appointment.user_id matches the authenticated user's sub claim.
  4. Returns the loaded AppointmentModel so route handlers don't need another DB hit.
